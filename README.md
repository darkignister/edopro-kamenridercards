# edopro-kamenridercards
Kamen Rider V2 Expansion of the EDOPRO. Custom EDOPRO cards.

**I do not own or am otherwise affiliated with Yu-Gi-Oh!, Kamen Rider, or EDOPro. This is merely a fan project that happens to involve all of them.**
**I do not own any of the images used in the card art for the card design**

**I do own the card design and the script for each card**

This is my 2nd version of the original Kamen Rider cards I made. The reason for the new version is because the original version is heavily outdated.

**To download the cards, please look at releases**
